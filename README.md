# IMDB Ratings Analysis and Visualization

This project is a data analysis and visualization of IMDB ratings of over 10,000 movies and shows. The data wrangling part is done in SQL, and the SQL database is connected to Python and visualized using libraries such as pandas, altair, and streamlit.

## Project Flow
## Data Wrangling
The initial step of the project involved cleaning and wrangling of the IMDB ratings data using SQL. This involved dealing with missing values, data type conversion, and data aggregation.

## Data Visualization
After cleaning the data, the next step was to perform exploratory data analysis using Python. Pandas, Altair, and Streamlit were used to create interactive visualizations, such as bar charts, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.

## Dashboard Creation
A Streamlit dashboard was created to present the visualizations in an interactive and user-friendly manner. The dashboard allowed the user to filter the data and visualize the results dynamically.

## Deployment
The final step was to deploy the dashboard using Streamlit. The deployment process made it possible for users to access the dashboard online and interact with the visualizations.
